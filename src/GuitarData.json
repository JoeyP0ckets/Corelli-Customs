Sometimes ya just gotta say.....WTF. This build for my Tasmanian rebel pal Richard turned out to be so much fun that I may do some more in the near future. You'll see the band Borrison Ivy slaying them with this custom Corelli Barncaster made of old knotty pine reclaimed from an old Nevada brothel. If the walls could talk! This guitar SINGS!  With mojo like that, it just gets better with Nick Bona's 'Bonafied' Tele Stack pickup which was custom wound specifically for this unique guitar.  The neck is quartersawn eastern hard rock maple. An amazing player and ultimate 'sleeper' guitar.","id":"2"},

The fretless neck is made of pheasantwood, and the fretted neck is made of koai‘a (the denser lowland sister species to koa, and the only other endemic Hawaiian acacia... it's so dense it sinks in water). Both necks have Big Island iliahi (sandalwood) fingerboards and the headstock is faced in primavera stained to match the body. Both necks also have position markers made of 1.7mm diameter diamonds set in 14k gold tubing and a tenth diamond dots the 'i' in 'Corelli' on the headstock--for a total of .2 carats of diamonds in each neck.","id":"5"},

Her body is curved like a Warwick or a Spector.  1) Her body is made from milo, which is known for good bass response in ukulele construction. 2) her top is made from iliahi (from the same piece as the fingerboards on Gemelli), which aside from smelling delicous is harder than maple. 3) Her knobs are made from lama, or Hawaiian ebony (a true ebony species). 4) Her jackplate is made from hala (as in lauhala), 5) her cavity cover is made from kou, 6) her head piece is made from ‘ohia, 7 & 8 ) her neck is made from a laminate of koai‘a (dominantly) and koa (had to have the two sister species forming the neck!) and 9) the fretboard is made from a‘ali‘i -- which is a wood so tough that frequently a‘ali‘i bushes are still growing after lava flows surround them and kill everything else (granted all the leaves burn off but they grow back).","id":"6"},
