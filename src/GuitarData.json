Sometimes ya just gotta say.....WTF. This build for my Tasmanian rebel pal Richard turned out to be so much fun that I may do some more in the near future. You'll see the band Borrison Ivy slaying them with this custom Corelli Barncaster made of old knotty pine reclaimed from an old Nevada brothel. If the walls could talk! This guitar SINGS!  With mojo like that, it just gets better with Nick Bona's 'Bonafied' Tele Stack pickup which was custom wound specifically for this unique guitar.  The neck is quartersawn eastern hard rock maple. An amazing player and ultimate 'sleeper' guitar.","id":"2"},
